# Leaflet-Challenge

The **United States Geological Survey (USGS)** provides scientific data about many aspects of our ecosystem, including natural hazards. This project takes a dive specifically into their Earthquake data. 

With the use of both HTML and Javascript, an interactive map was created to dislpay the USGS's Earthquake data in a meaningful way. 


The map is centered on the United States, but there is data respresented on other locations in the world. Each circle on the map represents an Earthquake that has occured between the the current date to 30 days prior, and with a magnitude of 2 or higher. The size/radius of the circle is based on the magnitude of the Earthquake - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger. The user can zoom in to get a better veiw the cirles's size. 

Each cirlce is also equipped with a pop-up that will display the Earthquakes: 
    - Location
    - Time and Date that event occured
    - Magnitude
    - Depth(km)
